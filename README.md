## Overview
It was a challenging project because I still don't have much experience with forms,
I believe it is far from perfect but I managed to solve it, I hope to improve this code soon
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
